# React Password Strength Checker

A modern, responsive password strength checker built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This application provides real-time feedback on password strength based on multiple criteria, helping users create more secure passwords. It also features a sleek dark mode, with the theme persisting across browser sessions.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Real-time Strength Analysis**: Instantly evaluates the password as the user types.
-   **Visual Feedback**: A color-coded strength bar (Weak, Fair, Good, Strong) and percentage indicator.
-   **Dynamic Criteria Checklist**: Shows which requirements (e.g., length, uppercase, number) have been met.
-   **Light & Dark Mode**: A theme toggle allows users to switch between light and dark modes, with the preference saved in `localStorage`.
-   **Show/Hide Password**: A toggle to view or mask the password for better usability.
-   **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
-   **Security Tips**: Provides helpful tips for creating stronger passwords.

## ü§ñ A Note on "Vibe Coding"

This project was developed using a modern approach called **Vibe Coding**.

> Vibe coding is a modern approach to software development where you use natural language‚Äîeither spoken or typed‚Äîto describe what you want a program to do, and then an AI (usually a large language model, or LLM) generates the actual code for you. Instead of manually writing every line of code, you give the AI high-level instructions or prompts, and it handles the technical implementation.

This method allowed for rapid prototyping and iteration, translating high-level feature requests (like "add a dark mode toggle in the top-right corner") directly into functional, production-ready code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript to improve code quality and maintainability.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
-   **Create React App**: The project's foundation.
-   **Craco**: (Create React App Configuration Override) Used to configure Tailwind CSS with Create React App without ejecting.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Install Craco (Required for Tailwind CSS):**
    This project uses Craco to enable Tailwind CSS without ejecting from Create React App. If it's not already in `package.json`, you must install it.
    ```sh
    npm install @craco/craco --save-dev
    ```

5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

-   `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
-   `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
-   `npm run eject`: **(Not Recommended)** Removes the single build dependency from your project. This is a one-way operation.
